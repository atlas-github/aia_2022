Shares of Twitter have dropped more than 17% since the deal was announced.In a statement to Yahoo Finance on Monday, a Twitter spokesperson said: \"Twitter has and will continue to cooperatively share information with Mr. Musk to consummate the transaction in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.
